# Metu Rover Science Control Unit

Welcome to the Metu Rover Science Control Unit! This repository contains the control card designs for Metu Rover Team's rover. The control cards play a crucial role in the rover's soil analysis and air sensor functions.

## Soil Analysis Unit

The Soil Analysis Unit is an essential component of the Metu Rover. It is mounted on the rover's back and is responsible for collecting soil data and analyzing it to determine the presence of living organisms. The unit utilizes advanced technologies to gather data and provides valuable insights into the composition and condition of the soil. The results obtained from the soil analysis aid in understanding the viability of potential habitats.

## Air Sensor Antenna

The Air Sensor Antenna is another integral part of Metu Rover's Analysis Unit. This antenna is designed to collect data from the surrounding air and analyze the air quality. By monitoring various parameters such as particulate matter, gases, and other relevant factors, the rover can assess the habitability of the planet or environment it is exploring. The data collected by the Air Sensor Antenna helps researchers and scientists make informed decisions about the suitability of an area for potential exploration or settlement.
