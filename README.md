# METU Rover Project (2019â€“2022)
# Overview
The METU Rover project focuses on developing advanced robotics solutions for exploration, object detection, and autonomous navigation. During my involvement from 2019 to 2022, I contributed to various aspects of the project, including hardware integration, software development, and algorithm optimization.

# Features

* Object Detection: Implemented temperature-initiated object detection algorithms.
* Autonomous Navigation: Enhanced path planning and obstacle avoidance mechanisms.
* Modular Design: Ensured scalability and modularity in system design.
